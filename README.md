# Library Catalogue System  

## Project Overview  
The **Library Catalogue System** is a Java-based application designed to manage a collection of books efficiently. The system allows users to:  
- Add new books to the catalogue  
- View books by different categories  
- Edit book details  
- Read and write book data from a file  

The project adheres to manual array-based storage instead of using ArrayLists, HashMaps, or advanced collections.  

## Features  
- **Book Management:** Add, edit, and display books.  
- **Author Handling:** Each book can have up to three authors.  
- **File Handling:** Load and save book data using basic file operations.  
- **User Interaction:** Simple text-based menu system.  

## Technologies Used  
- Java (Core Java, File Handling, Arrays)  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles  

## File Structure  

## How to Run  

1. **Compile the Java files:**  
javac src/*.java

3. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the system.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).  
- Introduce a search and filtering system.  
- Add book borrowing and return functionality.
